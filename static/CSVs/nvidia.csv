Every custom build, similar to this config, was well above 50k(considering the hardware and software). Hence i ended up buying this gorgeous CPU. A worthy buy under 45k, as you also get 3 years onsite warranty. Some people might feel that the ROM is less. You can either buy a USB HDD or if you are not too much concerned of the warranty, you can upgrade the ROM :)"
